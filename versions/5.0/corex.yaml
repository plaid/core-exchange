  title: FDX V5.0
  description: |
    The Core Exchange API documents endpoints that are compliant with the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) v5.0 Core API. Your organization can use these endpoints to support Plaid's 
    (or other data networks') requests for your customers' account details, balances, and other information. 
    Please note that this specification is subject to change as we make improvements to the product. If you have questions, please reach out to the Plaid team at dataconnectivity@plaid.com.
    
    ## FDX compliance
    
    The Core Exchange API Specifications are a subset of the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) API specification, the usage thereof (or any part thereof) constitutes acceptance of the FDX API 
    License Agreement, which can be found at https://financialdataexchange.org/. The FDX API specification is distributed exclusively by FDX. Modifications to eliminate required or 
    conditional elements prescribed in the FDX API Certification Use Cases will render any implementations using said modifications non-conformant with the FDX API Certification Use Cases.
    Please note that building the FDX-compliant Core Exchange API and permitting Plaid to call your build constitutes acceptance of 
    the FDX end user license agreement, which can be found at https://financialdataexchange.org/. 
    The full FDX API standard specification is distributed exclusively by FDX.
    
    ## Security
    
    Secure the Core Exchange API using OpenID Connect (OIDC), the preferred method. Plaid recommends enabling App2App.
    Implement the Core Exchange API to accept the access token as a bearer token, for example so that Plaid can send a query like: 
    `curl https://api.<your-organization>.com/fdx/v5/accounts -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'`. For details about implementing security, reach out to the Plaid team.
    
    
    ## Plaid integration and interoperability
    
    **NOTE:** This specification describes the subset of FDX endpoints required by Plaid, as well as the subset of FDX information Plaid consumes from each endpoint.  
    Plaid takes the following approach to documenting the subsets:
    
    - ENUMS: In cases where an endpoint describes FDX enums that Plaid doesn't consume, this specification notes the enums Plaid consumes, but refrains from removing unused enums.
    This documentation approach enables your organization to more easily integrate your Core Exchange implementation with other data networks.
    For example, this specification defines many account types, so the `GET \accounts\{id}` endpoint notes which ones Plaid consumes. For a summary, see [FDX data subsets](/core-exchange/fdx-data-subsets).
    
    - SCHEMAS: In cases where an endpoint describes FDX schemas that Plaid doesn't consume, this specification *omits* the schema. 
    
    ## Mock server
    
    See the [mock server postman collection](/core-exchange/example).

        Plaid consumes this endpoint as an alternate method of customer identification if you use Oauth2.
        If you instead use OIDC (recommended), Plaid identifies the customer using the OIDC `id_token` response, and you don't need to implement this endpoint.

    DebitCreditMemo:

      description:  |
        The posting type of a transaction. The transaction amount is always positive, and this parameter indicates the direction of the transaction.
        Plaid expects `DEBIT` or `CREDIT` for this enum. Plaid expects that your organization indicates
        the `MEMO` (i.e., pending) status using the `status` field in the transaction response rather than this field. 
        If your organization sends `MEMO` in this `DebitCreditMemo` enum, Plaid 
        handles this value the same as it handles `DEBIT`.
        * `DEBIT`: An amount leaves the account
        * `CREDIT`: An amount enters the account
        * `MEMO`: A pending transaction to be completed at the end of this day.

    TransactionStatus:
      title: Transaction Status
      description:  |
        The status of a transaction. Plaid consumes solely the `PENDING` and `POSTED` enums, 
        and treats `MEMO` and `AUTHORIZATION` as if they were `PENDING`. Plaid expects that pending and posted transactions
        have different `transactionIds`.  
        * `AUTHORIZATION` 
        * `MEMO` - A pending transaction to be completed at the end of this day 
        * `PENDING` - A pending transaction 
        * `POSTED` - A posted transaction

        - AUTHORIZATION
        - MEMO
