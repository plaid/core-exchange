    DebitCreditMemo:
      title: DebitCreditMemo
      description: |
        The posting type of a transaction. The transaction amount is an absolute value, and this parameter indicates the direction of the transaction.
        Plaid expects `DEBIT` or `CREDIT` for this enum. Plaid expects that your organization indicates
        the `MEMO` (i.e., pending) status using the `status` field in the transaction response rather than this field.
        If your organization sends `MEMO` in this `DebitCreditMemo` enum, Plaid
        handles this value the same as it handles `DEBIT`.
        * `DEBIT`: An amount leaves the account
        * `CREDIT`: An amount enters the account
        * `MEMO`: A pending transaction to be completed at the end of this day.

        - CREDIT
        - DEBIT
        - MEMO
