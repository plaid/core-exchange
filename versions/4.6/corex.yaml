            Note that while the [FDX specification]((https://financialdataexchange.org) enables associating holders and their
            contact information in the full `AccountHolder` schema, Plaid doesn't consume these associations.
            Instead, Plaid consumes limited information for each `AccountHolder` and doesn't associate contact information such as emails,
            addresses, or telephone numbers to account holders.
            For more information about Plaid's data model for account contact information, see [Identity](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/identity/).

    InvestmentTransactionType:
      title: Investment Transaction Type
      description: |
        The type of an investment transaction.
        Plaid maps these enums to Plaid [investment transaction types](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#investment-transaction-types-schema).
        Plaid doesn't map these enums to Plaid-specific transaction subtypes.
        Plaid maps these enums as follows:
        
        * ADJUSTMENT - fee
        * ATM - cash
        * CASH - cash
        * CHECK - cash
        * CLOSURE - Plaid suggests using SOLDTOCLOSE, PURCHASETOCLOSE, OPTIONEXERCISE or OPTIONEXPIRATION to indicate the specific type of closure, instead of using this enum.
