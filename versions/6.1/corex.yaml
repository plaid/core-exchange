    Please note that building the FDX-compliant Core Exchange API and permitting Plaid to call your build constitutes acceptance of
    the FDX end user license agreement, which can be found at https://financialdataexchange.org/.

    ## Download the specification
    
    To view this specification and documentation as an OpenAPI YAML file, see [the public Core Exchange Github repository](https://github.com/plaid/core-exchange/tree/main/versions).

    ## Endpoints

    This specification contains the following endpoints:

      - `/customers/current`

      - `/accounts`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/payment-networks`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/asset-transfer-networks`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/statements`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/statements/{statementId}`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/contact`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/transactions`

    ## Error responses

    An error entity which can be used at the API level for error responses or at the account level to indicate a problem specific to a particular account.
    Error responses must contain a `code` and `message`, and may optionally include a `debugMessage`.
    See the descriptions below:

    - `code`: The FDX error code: A long-term persistent identifier which can be used to trace error condition back to log information.
      (**Note:** This code may differ from the HTTP status code.)
    - `message`: End user displayable information which might help the customer diagnose an error
    - `debugMessage`: Message used to debug the root cause of the error. Contents should not be used in consumer's business logic. Can change at any time and should only be used for consumer to communicate with the data provider about an issue. Provider can include an error GUID in message for their use

    ### Example error

    The following is an example response with an HTTP status code of 409.

    ```
    {
      "code": 705,
      "message": "Account is closed",
      "debugMessage": "Operation is not supported by the closed account"
    }
    ```

    See the Errors table in each endpoint description for more specific message and debug message examples.

      description: |
        Number of elements that the API consumer wishes to receive.
        Plaid has a default limit of 100 elements. If this value differs from your organization's limit for the number of items to send in one response, then pick
        the lower of the two different limits and use the lower limit to define the number of items you send on each page of a paginated response.
        Plaid then gets the next page by making a new request with the opaque `nextOffset` field that your organization returned in the latest response,
        until your organization omits `nextOffset` in the response to indicate the last page

        Contains opaque identifier, `nextoffset`, for paginated result sets. The `nextOffset` ID doesn't need to be numeric or have any specific pattern.
        In other words, your organization can implement this however you prefer.
        The presence of this offset indicates that there's at least one more page of data available.
        The absence of this offset indicates that there are no more pages of data left in this paginated array.

            contact information in the full `AccountHolder` schema, Plaid doesn't consume these associations.
            Instead, Plaid consumes limited information for each `AccountHolder` and doesn't associate contact information such as emails,
            addresses, or telephone numbers to account holders.
