    The Core Exchange API specifications are a subset of the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) API specification, the usage thereof (or any part thereof) constitutes acceptance of the FDX API
    License Agreement, which can be found at https://financialdataexchange.org/. The FDX API specification is distributed exclusively by FDX. Modifications to eliminate required or

    Please note that building the FDX-compliant Core Exchange API and permitting Plaid to call your build constitutes acceptance of
    the FDX end user license agreement, which can be found at https://financialdataexchange.org/.
    The full FDX API standard specification is distributed exclusively by FDX.
    
    ## Download the specification
    
    To view this specification and documentation as an OpenAPI YAML file, see [the public Core Exchange Github repository](https://github.com/plaid/core-exchange/tree/main/versions).

    ## Endpoints

    This specification contains the following endpoints:

      - `/customers/current`

      - `/accounts`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/payment-networks`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/statements`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/statements/{statementId}`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/contact`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/transactions`

    ## Error responses

    An error entity which can be used at the API level for error responses or at the account level to indicate a problem specific to a particular account.
    Error responses must contain a `code` and `message`, and may optionally include a `debugMessage`.
    See the descriptions below:

    - `code`: The FDX error code: A long-term persistent identifier which can be used to trace error condition back to log information.
      (**Note:** This code may differ from the HTTP status code.)
    - `message`: End user displayable information which might help the customer diagnose an error
    - `debugMessage`: Message used to debug the root cause of the error. Contents should not be used in consumer's business logic. Can change at any time and should only be used for consumer to communicate with the data provider about an issue. Provider can include an error GUID in message for their use

    ### Example error

    The following is an example response with an HTTP status code of 409.

    ```
    {
      "code": 705,
      "message": "Account is closed",
      "debugMessage": "Operation is not supported by the closed account"
    }
    ```

    See the Errors table in each endpoint description for more specific message and debug message examples.

        **Info**: Plaid does not use `/accounts/{accountId}` for annuity accounts, commercial accounts, or insurance accounts. However, these accounts are still included in the `/accounts` list, so that they are discoverable by users.

    LimitQuery:
      name: limit
      in: query
      description: |
        The number of elements that the API consumer wishes to receive. Plaid has a default limit of 100 elements. If your organization has a different limit, use the lower limit to determine how many items to send per page. To retrieve multiple pages, Plaid will use the opaque `nextOffset` field to send a subsequent request until the `nextOffset` is no longer included.

        type: integer

    OffsetQuery:
      name: offset
      in: query
      description: |
        An opaque ID that indicates there is at least one more page of data available. This value does not need to be numeric or have any specific pattern. If provided, Plaid will use this value to send a new request and retrieve the next page. Omitting this value indicates that there is no more data to retrieve.

            Note that while the [FDX specification](https://financialdataexchange.org) enables associating holders and their
            contact information in the full `AccountHolder` schema, Plaid doesn't consume these associations.
            Instead, Plaid consumes limited information for each `AccountHolder` and doesn't associate contact information such as emails,
            addresses, or telephone numbers to account holders.
