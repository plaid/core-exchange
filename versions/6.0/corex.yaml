    the FDX end user license agreement, which can be found at https://financialdataexchange.org/.

    ## Download the specification
    
    To view this specification and documentation as an OpenAPI YAML file, see [the public Core Exchange Github repository](https://github.com/plaid/core-exchange/tree/main/versions).

    ## Endpoints

    This specification contains the following endpoints:

      - `/customers/current`

      - `/accounts`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/payment-networks`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/asset-transfer-networks`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/statements`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/statements/{statementId}`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/contact`

      - `/accounts/{accountId}/transactions`

    ## Error responses

    An error entity which can be used at the API level for error responses or at the account level to indicate a problem specific to a particular account.
    Error responses must contain a `code` and `message`, and may optionally include a `debugMessage`.
    See the descriptions below:

    - `code`: The FDX error code: A long-term persistent identifier which can be used to trace error condition back to log information.
      (**Note:** This code may differ from the HTTP status code.)
    - `message`: End user displayable information which might help the customer diagnose an error
    - `debugMessage`: Message used to debug the root cause of the error. Contents should not be used in consumer's business logic. Can change at any time and should only be used for consumer to communicate with the data provider about an issue. Provider can include an error GUID in message for their use

    ### Example error

    The following is an example response with an HTTP status code of 409.

    ```
    {
      "code": 705,
      "message": "Account is closed",
      "debugMessage": "Operation is not supported by the closed account"
    }
    ```

    See the Errors table in each endpoint description for more specific message and debug message examples.

        Number of elements that the API consumer wishes to receive. Plaid has a default limit of 100 elements.
