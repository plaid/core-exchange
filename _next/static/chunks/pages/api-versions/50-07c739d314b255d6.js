If you have questions, please reach out to the Plaid team at dataconnectivity@plaid.com.\n\n## FDX compliance\n\nThe Core Exchange API Specifications are a subset of the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) API specification, the usage thereof (or any part thereof) constitutes acceptance of the FDX API \nLicense Agreement, which can be found at https://financialdataexchange.org/. The FDX API specification is distributed exclusively by FDX. Modifications to eliminate required or \nconditional elements prescribed in the FDX API Certification Use Cases will render any implementations using said modifications non-conformant with the FDX API Certification Use Cases.\nPlease note that building the FDX-compliant Core Exchange API and permitting Plaid to call your build constitutes acceptance of \nthe FDX end user license agreement, which can be found at https://financialdataexchange.org/. \nThe full FDX API standard specification is distributed exclusively by FDX.\n\n## Security\n\nSecure the Core Exchange API using OpenID Connect (OIDC), the preferred method. Plaid recommends enabling App2App.\nImplement the Core Exchange API to accept the access token as a bearer token, for example so that Plaid can send a query like: \n`curl https://api.<your-organization>.com/fdx/v5/accounts -H 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'`.\n\n## Plaid integration and interoperability\n\n**NOTE:** This specification describes the subset of FDX endpoints required by Plaid, as well as the subset of FDX information Plaid consumes from each endpoint.  \nPlaid takes the following approach to documenting the subsets:\n\n- ENUMS: In cases where an endpoint describes enums that Plaid doesn't consume, this specification notes the enums Plaid consumes, but refrains from removing unused enums.\nThis documentation approach enables your organization to more easily integrate your Core Exchange implementation with other data networks.\nFor example, this specification defines many account types, so the `GET \\accounts\\{id}` endpoint notes which ones Plaid consumes. For a summary, see [FDX data subsets](/fdx-data-subsets).\n\n- SCHEMAS: In cases where an endpoint describes schemas that Plaid doesn't consume, this specification *omits* the schema. \n\nIf you choose to implement only the response information that Plaid consumes, bear in mind that if you integrate with other data networks, \nthey may request you to implement more of the FDX-compliant response information documented in this FDX specification.\n\n## Mock server\n\nSee the [mock server postman collection](/example). \n",contact:{name:"Plaid support",url:"https://plaid.com/data-connectivity-core-exchange/",email:"dataconnectivity@plaid.com"}},servers:[{url:"https://api.<your-organization>.com/fdx/v5",description:"Financial Data Exchange V5.0 Core API"}],tags:[{name:"Personal Information",description:"Search and view customer or customers"},{name:"Account Information",description:"Search and view customer accounts"},{name:"Account Transactions",description:"Search and view account transactions"}],paths:{"/customers/current":{get:{operationId:"getCustomerId",tags:["Personal Information"],description:"Get the id of the customer within the authorization scope.
