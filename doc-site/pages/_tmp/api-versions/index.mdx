# Overview

When your organization builds Core Exchange, you implement a Financial Data Exchange (FDX)-aligned API.
This API handles GET HTTP requests that the Plaid network (or other data networks that you partner with) send.
These requests are for information about your customers' financial accounts.
Please note that this specification is subject to change as we make improvements to the product.
If you have questions, please reach out to the [Plaid team](mailto:dataconnectivity@plaid.com).

### Versions

See the following API references for the Core Exchange versions that Plaid supports. Core Exchange uses the same version numbers as FDX.

- [V6.0 Core Exchange API specification](/api-versions/six-dot-zero)
- [V5.3 Core Exchange API specification](/api-versions/five-dot-three)
- [V5.2 Core Exchange API specification](/api-versions/five-dot-two)
- [V5.1 Core Exchange API specification](/api-versions/five-dot-one)
- [V5.0 Core Exchange API specification](/api-versions/five-dot-zero)
- [V4.6 Core Exchange API specification](/api-versions/four-dot-six)

For version information, see the [changelist](/changelist).

### Plaid integration and interoperability

The Core Exchange specifications describe the subset of FDX endpoints required by Plaid, as well as the subset of FDX information Plaid consumes
from each endpoint.  Plaid takes the following approach to documenting these subsets:

- **ENUMS**: In cases where an endpoint describes FDX enums that Plaid doesn't consume, the specifications note the enums Plaid consumes, but refrains from removing unused enums.
  This enables your organization to more easily integrate your Core Exchange implementation with other data networks.
  For example, FDX defines many account type enums, so the specifications retain these enums but notes which account type enums Plaid consumes in the `GET \accounts\{id}` endpoint reference.

- **SCHEMAS**: In cases where an endpoint describes FDX schemas that Plaid doesn't consume, the specification *omits* the schema.
