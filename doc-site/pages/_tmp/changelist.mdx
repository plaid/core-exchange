# API Changelist

See the following changelist for updates to the Core Exchange specification. Core Exchange uses the same version numbers as FDX.

## [V6.0 Core Exchange API specification](https://plaid.github.io/core-exchange/api-versions/six-dot-zero)

### FDX changelist

In PaymentNetworkType adding US_FEDNOW (Federal Reserve Instant Payment System)

#### Breaking changes

In AccountWithDetails (response for `/accounts/{accountId}` endpoint) removing the seven xxxAccount: properties and requiring discriminator value accountCategory:
on each account type, one of ANNUITY_ACCOUNT, COMMERCIAL_ACCOUNT, DEPOSIT_ACCOUNT, INSURANCE_ACCOUNT, INVESTMENT_ACCOUNT, LOAN_ACCOUNT or LOC_ACCOUNT.
These values have not changed since prior versions v5.2 and v5.3

An implementer’s mapping of each Account must set required AccountDescriptor property accountCategory,
and account is no longer wrapped with a named property (like depositAccount) when set into an AccountWithDetails response object.

In Transactions removing the six xxxTransaction: properties and requiring discriminator value accountCategory: on each transaction type. The property accountCategory and its use on Transaction types is new.

An implementer’s mapping of each Transaction must set required Transaction property accountCategory,
and transaction is no longer wrapped with a named property (like depositTransaction) when set into a Transactions response object.

Holding response object also now supports an array of securityIds with id/idType pairs instead of a single securityId/securityIdType pair of identifiers.
