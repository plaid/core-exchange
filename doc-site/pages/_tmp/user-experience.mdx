# User experience

[Plaid Link](https://plaid.com/docs/link/) is the UI component users interact with to link their accounts to an app using Plaid.
Your institution will show up in Plaid Link after you go live on Core Exchange.

## Institution selection

A user wants to connect their financial account to an app called WonderWallet.
WonderWallet sends them to Plaid Link where they can select their financial institution.
In this example, the financial institution is called First Platypus Bank.

## Authentication

### OAuth

The user is asked to authenticate with First Platypus.
Plaid recommends you do this using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

You own the OAuth user experience and host it on your domain.
We encourage you have two screens with your logo prominently featured: a login screen and two-step verification screen.

### App2app

[App2app](https://openid.net/tag/app2app/) is a mechanism that allows mobile apps performing OAuth2 or OpenID Connect based authentication to offer a much simpler faster flow if the user already has an app provided by the authorization server owner installed on their mobile device.
The example below uses App2app.

The user is brought to the First Platypus app to authenticate where they can use biometrics.

### WebAuthn

We also recommend using [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide/) for web-based authentication.
Users can enroll and then easily use biometrics to authenticate on any web browser.

## Account selection

If the user has more than one financial account, the user returns to Plaid Link and is asked to select which accounts they’d like to link.
The user then sees a success screen.
Tapping the continue button will return them to WonderWallet.

## Returning user experience

Plaid’s returning user experience streamlines onboarding for users who have previously connected a financial account with Plaid via your institution’s OAuth and API integration.

In [Link](https://plaid.com/docs/link/), a user can choose to be remembered by Plaid by entering their phone number and then verifying it using a one-time password.
Next, the user connects their account through your OAuth flow, which would be associated with their phone number.
When the same user wants to connect their account to another app, Plaid enables the user to do so using their phone number and secure authentication methods like one-time passcodes and passkeys.
This streamlined experience has built-in security controls and advanced monitoring that automatically detect suspicious activity and help prevent fraud.

As a data partner for Core Exchange, you’re automatically enabled for this streamlined experience with no integration work required.
Your users can now opt-in and benefit from a faster way to securely connect their accounts to apps and services on the Plaid network.
