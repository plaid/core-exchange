# Implementation checklists

## Pre-implementation checklist


- Scope technical work:


  - Identify components of your infrastructure that handle authentication. Plaid expects that you secure the Core Exchange API using an OIDC authorization server.



  - Review the [Core Exchange API Reference documentation](/api-versions). To see the API specification in action, try out our [Postman collection](/example), which provides example Core Exchange responses from a mock bank server. Review a highlight of the [subsets of FDX information](/fdx-data-subsets) Plaid consumes.


- Review infrastructure to determine readiness:

  - Identify components of your infrastructure that handle account, owner, and transaction data elements.

  - Ensure infrastructure can support Plaid request volume (to be provided by the Plaid team).


- Reach out to the Plaid team to complete setup:

  - Email your contact at Plaid to create a Slack channel for your team to use as a real-time communication conduit during design, build, and deployment.

  - Provide the following information to Plaid:

    - Your organization's name, logo, and URL. Plaid uses this information to populate your organization's details in Plaid Link. Your logo file must be in vector format (svg, eps, ai, or sketch).

    - Planned Core Exchange server URL, for example `https://api.<your-organization>.com/fdx/v5`.

    - The location of your authorization server. Plaid expects this to be an OAuth2 server that implements OIDC, and expects to be able to make a request to the standard OIDC relative URL `/.well-known/openid-configuration.json`.
      For more information see the [OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).
      If your OAuth identity provider doesn't implement OIDC, discuss your security flow with Plaid in as much detail as possible.

    - Your client ID, and your client secret. Share your public key and test credentials either via email or Slack channel.

    - Create test users and provide their credentials for [API validation](/implementation-checklists#validation-checklist) and production.

- Reach out to the Plaid team to schedule a call to address outstanding technical questions. The Plaid team will review your organizationâ€™s infrastructure components, for example,
  middleware, API proxies, identity providers, firewalls, or any other enterprise infrastructure that requires configuration before API validation.


## Implementation checklist

- Set up the OIDC security you planned in the pre-implementation phase.

- Get a jumpstart on implementing the Core Exchange API by generating code from the API specification in the language of your choice. For more information, see the [Core Exchange Github repository](https://github.com/plaid/core-exchange#code-generation-from-the-api-specification).
  The specification contains the following endpoints:

  - `/customer/current` (implement this only if you can't implement OIDC)

  - `/accounts`

  - `/accounts/{accountId}`

  - `/accounts/{accountId}/payment-networks`

  - `/accounts/{accountId}/contacts`

  - `/accounts/{accountId}/transactions`

- Restrict access to the planned Core Exchange server implementation to Plaid IPs. Reach out to the Plaid team for the lists of these IPs.

- For mTLS connectivity, share specifications for the Client intermediary certification requirements (Plaid can provide a self-signed or third-party certificate depending on requirement)



## Validation checklist

- Validate your Core Exchange implementation using a validator tool provided by Plaid.  If you need help, reach out to the Plaid team via email or Slack.
- The validator checks, among other things:
  - field names are in `dromedaryCamelCase`
  - all fields are spelled and named correctly
  - all field values are of the correct type as outlined in the specification
  - the correct HTTP status codes are returned


## Product launch checklist

- When your Core Exchange implementation is live, request production access.
- Optionally, if you want to make an external launch announcement, reach out to our Plaid team to discuss your announcement and materials at [dataconnectivity@plaid.com](mailto:dataconnectivity@plaid.com).
