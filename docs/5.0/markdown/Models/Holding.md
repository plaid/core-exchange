# Holding
## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **securityId** | **String** | Plaid requires this field and &#x60;securityIdType&#x60; for: - holding types that use security IDs, such as stocks and options. - transactions involving such holding types. If you return this for a holding, Plaid looks up the close price from NYSE Group Security Master using the security ID. If you don&#39;t return this for a holding that uses security IDs (not recommended), Plaid uses the &#x60;currentUnitPrice&#x60; you return as the close price.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **securityIdType** | [**SecurityIdType**](SecurityIdType.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **holdingName** | **String** | Holding name or security name | [optional] [default to null] |
| **holdingType** | [**HoldingType**](HoldingType.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |

| **symbol** | **String** | Ticker / Market symbol | [optional] [default to null] |
| **purchasedPrice** | **BigDecimal** | Price of holding at the time of purchase. Plaid determines an approximate [cost basis](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-holdings-cost-basis) using the purchase price and the number of units. Plaid cannot take fees into account to determine the cost basis because the FDX holding schema doesn&#39;t include fees.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **currentUnitPrice** | **BigDecimal** | Current unit price. Plaid uses this as the [institution_price](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-holdings-institution-price). Plaid falls back to using this as the [close price](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-securities-close-price) if you don&#39;t return &#x60;securityId&#x60; for holdings involving securities.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **currentUnitPriceDate** | **date** | ISO 8601 full-date in format &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39; according to [IETF RFC3339](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/public/rfc/html/rfc3339.html#anchor14) | [optional] [default to null] |
| **units** | **BigDecimal** | Plaid requires this field for holdings and transactions involving securities. For security-based actions other than stock splits, quantity. Shares for stocks, mutual funds, and others. Face value for bonds. Contracts for options.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **marketValue** | **BigDecimal** | Market value at the time of data retrieved | [default to null] |
| **faceValue** | **BigDecimal** | Required for bonds. Face value at the time of data retrieved. If this isn&#39;t present, Plaid assumes the holding  isn&#39;t a bond and falls back to &#x60;marketValue&#x60;.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **cashAccount** | **Boolean** | If true, indicates that this holding is used to maintain proceeds from sales, dividends, and other cash postings to the investment account. If you don&#39;t set a value for &#x60;isCashEquivalent&#x60; in the &#x60;fiAttributes&#x60; array, then Plaid uses &#x60;cashAccount&#x60; in determining the [is_cash_equivalent](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-securities-is-cash-equivalent) status.  | [default to null] |
| **currency** | [**Currency**](Currency.md) |  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **fiAttributes** | [**List**](FiAttribute.md) | Array of financial institution-specific attributes. Plaid recommends including a value for [is_cash_equivalent](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments-holdings-get-response-securities-is-cash-equivalent) property in this array. Plaid accepts &#x60;isCashEquivalent&#x60; as the name and a string &#x60;true&#x60; or &#x60;false&#x60; as the value. If you return a value for &#x60;isCashEquivalent&#x60;, then return the same value for &#x60;cashAccount&#x60; as a boolean.  | [optional] [default to null] |
