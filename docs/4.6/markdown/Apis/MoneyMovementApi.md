### Parameters

|Name | Type | Description  | Notes |
|------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| **accountId** | **String**| Account identifier, found in the &#x60;GET /accounts&#x60; endpoint response. Plaid expects the ID is not the same as the account number. | [default to null] |
| **offset** | **String**| Plaid receives this value from your organization&#39;s latest response in a paginated response, and returns it to in a new request to get the next page. Your organization omits &#x60;nextOffset&#x60; in the response to indicate the last page.  | [optional] [default to null] |
| **limit** | **Integer**| Number of elements that the API consumer wishes to receive. Plaid has a default limit of 100 elements. If this value differs from your organization&#39;s limit for the number of items to send in one response, then pick the lower of the two different limits and use the lower limit to define the number of items you send on each page of a paginated response. Plaid then gets the next page by making a new request with the opaque &#x60;nextOffset&#x60; field that your organization returned in the latest response, until your organization omits &#x60;nextOffset&#x60; in the response to indicate the last page.  | [optional] [default to null] |
