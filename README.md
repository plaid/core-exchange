# README

This repository contains the source files (.mdx and corex.yaml files) for the documentation at [plaid.github.io/core-exchange]( https://plaid.github.io/core-exchange).

# Generated Server Examples

We use [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) to generate example server implementations of Core Exchange in select programing languages for all programing langues. This can be done locally for any of the supported [Server Generators](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators) but if there is one that you would like to see added to our repository please open an [issue](https://github.com/plaid/core-exchange/issues).
